This is my first mod, be nice...<br />
<br />
This mod adds booby traps to minetest, I made it especially for the Hunger Games Server.<br />
<br />
Traps<br />
<br />
1) Mine (traps:mine)<br />
A block disguised as a grass block<br />
Ka Boom!. Code used from the Nuke Mod<br />

<br />
2) Cage Trap (traps:cage)<br />
A block disguised as a grass block<br />
When a player walks over the block, they get trapped in by glass.<br />
Another player has to release them by standing on the release block beside them.<br />

<br />
NOTE: You can use the variable "block_to_place" to change which block is placed for the walls of the cage (eg: to obidistan)<br />
<br />
I am open for any critisms, suggestions, alternate textures, and ideas for new traps<br />
